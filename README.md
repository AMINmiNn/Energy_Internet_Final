# Energy_Internet_Final
## The final project of Introduction of Energy Internet(2022-Spring)  
**Basic Assignment**:Based on skleran,try to find a best model to give an accurate prediction of the PV and the wind power output while the interpretation of the model is required.  
**Furthur Task**:Search for publications and find a feasible method to give the probability prediction.  
**And this project got a score of 4.0/4.0 finally**.
